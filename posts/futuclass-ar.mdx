### The game

It is a marker-based AR game prototype developed with Futuclass. The 3D models are provided by Futuclass. I am the sole developer for this project.

It is the software contribution of my Master thesis in the University of Tartu.

It is fully workable on the iOS platform and some device models on the Android platform.

Its content is currently available in Estonian only. If you are interested please contact Futuclass for a testing session.(info@futuclass.com)

Tool and framework used: Unity, C#, AR Foundation, Figma, Miro, ARKit, ARCore, Visual Studio, Xcode

Here is a short video of my work. A screen recording from iPhone 11. Enjoy!
