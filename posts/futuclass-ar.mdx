### The game

It is a marker-based AR game prototype developed with Futuclass. The 3D models are provided by Futuclass. I am the solo developer for this project.

It is the work for my Master thesis in University of Tartu.

It is fully workable on the iOS platform and on some device models of the Android platforms.

Its content is currently available in Estonian only. If you are interested please contact futuclass for a testing session.(info@futuclass.com)

Tool and framework used: Unity, C#, AR Foundation, Figma, Miro, ARKit, ARCore, VS, Xcode

This is a short video of my work. A screen recoding from my iPhone 11. Enjoy!
