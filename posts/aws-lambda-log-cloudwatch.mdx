## Conclucsion

It is a basic integration, which helps to show the automatic workflow status from CircleCi for associated tickets in Jira.

It is very scalable and easy to configure because all the configuration stuff would be just in one single yml file.

However, engineers might have to do some tricks but not just simply follow the guidance documents of CircleCI due to many changes related to dependencies and virtual environments.

When creating this demo, I had to dig into issues of the Github repository of the plugin multiple times for finding answers.

Still, it was pretty smooth since the CircleCI community is open source.
