### CircleCI Jira Integration


CircleCI is a continuous integration and continuous delivery platform that can be used to implement DevOps practices.

Jira is a software application known as the market standard in project management, task management, and issue tracking.

A demo was created to deomostrate the integration between two platforms.

There are 2 plugins listed on the Atlassian Marketplace for Jira. The most common one is the "CircleCI for Jira" plugin.
I have also tried the "CircleCI-Jira Integration Pro" plugin but then from the exprience, the "CircleCI for Jira"is providing a better automation experience.

I created a new jira instance on the Atlassian and followed this guide to set it up.

Repository I used: [behavior-driven-python](https://github.com/rolandshc/behavior-driven-python)
* Originally forked from [AndyLPK247](https://github.com/AndyLPK247)'s [behavior-driven-python](https://github.com/AndyLPK247/behavior-driven-python)
* Modified the repository a bit, only keep unit testing parts using pytest, pytest-BDD 
* [AndyLPK247](https://github.com/AndyLPK247) writes a very good dev blog [automationpanda](https://automationpanda.com/) about python, testing and automation, which I highly recommend.
