### Threejs in Flutter

In previous testings, I found out that the ar package i used in my flutter project was only supporting 3D objects in gltf and glb formats.
I hoped to implement a function for me to show the text input I type into the mobile app in AR.
I started to look for a gltf glb 3D model converter and I knew that there was on inside the three.js package.

I tried the dart version of that in a flutter project but it failed to run in iOS project.
It could run in the web project exported b y Flutter but it is not what I want this time.
Thus, I am looking for an alternative solution for now.
