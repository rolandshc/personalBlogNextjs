### AR development with Flutter

It has been a while since I tried out different plugins for building AR mobile applications using Flutter.

There are 3 plugins currently availabe on the pub.dev.

1. [ar_flutter_plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/ar_flutter_plugin)

2. [arkit_plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/arkit_plugin)

3. [arcore_flutter_plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/arcore_flutter_plugin)

I tried them all using:

1. Flutter 3.0.5 / 2.10.5
2. iOS 15
3. Android SDK 31

#### ar_flutter_plugin
It works well for both iOS and Android with the latest Flutter version for the AR object placement. Target to test out all different feature wrappers on both platforms.

#### arkit_plugin
The latest version was push 9 months ago but still I could run it after the Flutter 3.0 breaking changes.
Not continue to test this since the multiplatform plugin `ar_flutter_plugin` works now.

#### arcore_flutter_plugin
The latest version was push 14 months ago and it is not ready for null-safe. Not to test further until there is any update from the community.
