### Working remotely

After the pandemic, a lot of things have changed. Remote work has become a new benefit to employees. "On-site", "Remote" or "Hybrid" are becoming the three main categories for job seeking. Since the world is recovering, some companies are asking their employee to go back to the office. I am a guy who supports the working style of "fully remote" and I have been working remotely continuously for a whole year but I do see there are benefits of in-person team events. Probably, "Fully Remote" might not be suitable for everyone. Here is why:

### Trust and self-sufficiency

The remote worker has to have at least a certain degree of independence. The feeling of loneliness and isolation üò© might be an issue for some people. There might be some misunderstanding about the task assigning, progress and requirements from different parties. For a distributed team, it might be difficult to build trust between each other with only virtual meetings and slack channels. People have emotions. When people start having more free time, we need a new working model to work more efficiently with a healthy mental condition. One small tip from me is to praise üëèand thank üôè others' efforts with the words speaking out directly in a video call. It is huge ,and emojis could not do the same. And please, turn on the camera.üòÅ

Working remotely in Hong Kong for 2 months.

### Flexibility and ownership

Remote work allows us to travel more such as working in different cities and countries. It is usually a benefit usually listed on the job description. However, it might also make us lose the work-life balance when the work burden becomes heavy. Remote work has blurred the line between work and life. Learning to draw the physical boundary between work and off work helps a lot. Making scheduled messages and turning off notifications during me-time is very useful too.

### Values

I believed in remote work and I would continue to believe and adapt. Although there are adjustments we have to deal with, humanity could continue to grow and we could develop some better working patterns and solutions to be more efficient and healthy TOGETHER.
