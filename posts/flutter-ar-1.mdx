### AR development with Flutter

I have tested the screenshot example of the [ar_flutter_plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/ar_flutter_plugin).

However, the example given on pub.dev was not null-safe and not compatible with Flutter version 3.0.

The code base had been modified and it could be run on iOS and Android now. The available functionalities are:

1. Plane detection
2. Feature Points visualization
3. Adding anchor
4. Placing web object to the anchor created
5. Remove all objects' anchors
6. Object tapping detection
7. Taking the screenshot (no saving yet)

#### Modification

1. Removed AppBar and ARView constraint
2. ARView is now available in full screenshot
3. Add SafeArea feature for multiple Android devices support
