Keep getting busier last few months and really had no extra time to type some words here but,
I promised myself to keep this up so

In 2024, I have done quite a bit. Just to save some highlights here:

1. Attending the Apple Developer Lab in London Apple Office 
2. Purchased and moved to a new apartment
3. Having my 30th B-day with my dearest ❤️
4. Released our 1st VisionOS app on the AppStore
5. Chilling in the largest XR Converence in the Europe
6. Winning a prize in company-wise hackathon right after joining

I got help from so many people and,
I am not trying to be Steve Jobs but I am looking forwards to build more great things and improve the world.
