### Working remotely

After the pandemic, a lot of things have changed. Remote work has become a new benefit to employees. "On-site", "Remote" or "Hybrid" are becoming the three main categories for job seeking. Since the world is recovering, some companies are asking their employee to go back to the office. I am a guy who supports the working style of "fully remote" and I have been working remotely continuously for 1 whole year but I do see there are benefits of in-person team events and it is not suitable for everyone. Here is why:

### Trust and self-sufficiency
The remote worker has to have at least a certain degree of independence. The feeling of loneliness and isolation üò© might be an issue for some people. There might be some misunderstanding about the task assigning, progress and requirements from different parties. For a distributed team, it might be not easy to build trust between each other with only virtual meetings and slack channels. People have emotions. When people start to have more free time, it also needs a new way to work more efficiently with a healthy mental condition. What I keep doing is to praising üëèand thanking üôè others' efforts with the words speaking out directly. This is huge and emojis could not do the same.üòÅ

Working remotely in Hong Kong for 2 months.

### Flexibility and ownership

Working remotely allows us to do more travelling like working in different cities and different countries. This is usually a benefit usually listed on the job description. However, it might also make us lose the work-life balance when the work burden becomes huge. Remote work has blurred the line between work and life. Learning to draw the physical boundary between work and off work is important. Making scheduled messages and turning off notifications during me-time is also very useful to do so.

### Values

I believed in remote work and I would continue to believe in it. Although there are adjustments we have to deal with, humanity could continue to grow and we could develop some better working patterns and solutions to be more efficient and healthy.
