In May 2023, I attended the AWS Summit for the second time, having previously been to the one in Hong Kong in 2019. 
The sessions on MLOps and Serverless Workflow designs were enlightening, exposing me to the latest tech trends in the Nordic region. 
Plus, I got to savor some delicious free curry. It was an all-around fantastic experience! ðŸ˜‹

## MLOps

This slide left a profound impression on me, as it reminded me of a project where I had the incredible opportunity to 
collaborate with a deep learning product startup right from its inception. I was involved in every stage, 
from Proof of Concept (POC) and research papers to trial models, drafting product requirements, pitching the idea, raising millions in funding, 
and finally commencing the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) and MLLC (Machine Learning Life Cycle) until the successful first release.

This slide is very "AWS"-centric, focusing solely on their services.  
It is robust though and highlights the necessary tools and services for this cloud solution.
In practice, from my knowledge ML team would also make use of some powerful tools for model 
development like <a href="https://mlflow.org/ " target="_blank"> mlflow</a>.

## Serverless

The real "aha" moment truly struck when they shared the blueprint resources of `Step Functions`.
<a href=" https://serverlessland.com " target="_blank"> serverlessland.com</a>  is a really good resource for learning and designing servelss workflows.
Best practices are demostrated in workflows, snippets and patterns formats.
