### Thoughts

It was a well-structured course for me to refresh my mind for both soft and hard skills.

Most of the topics are useful except the last two chapters of the course, which are about using R. (Well, it is not an issue but I prefer Python more)

It covers all the basics of how to become a data analyst. For people without a relevant background, it is a good tutorial.

For experienced in the industry, it could be a good refreshment and should not take you so much time.


P.S. After blogging this, I am interested in implementing a comment function for this site to know your thoughts. Let's put this in my tight schedule.  =)
