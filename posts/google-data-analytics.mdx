### Thoughts

It was a well-structured course for me to refresh my mind for both soft skills and hard skills.

All looks good except the last two chapters of the course, which are about using R. (Well, it is not an issue but I prefer Python more)

It covers all basics of different aspects to be a data analyst. For people without a relevant background, it is a good tutorial for beginners.

For I.T. engineers with advanced knowledge in the I.T. industry, it is a good refreshment. It should not take you so much time.


P.S. After blogging this, I am interested in implementing a comment function for this site to know your thoughts. Let's put this in my tight schedule.  =)
